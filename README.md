First Homework deliverables:

1) Shall statements
2) Context diagram
3) Use-case diagram


Second Homework deliverables:

ER-diagram: based on the domain description from Assignment #1

Third Assignment Goals:

2.1 Create database structure: convert your ER diagram into a real database using Data
Definition Language (DDL). Keep in mind that your database structure must also preserve
integrity and consistency of your data and must be in the third normal form (normalization
will be presented in future classes, tutorials and labs).
2.2 Populate your database with sample data: provide sample data for each table (HINT:
writing a Python3 script or Java to generate data may save you some time).
2.3 Implement SELECT queries: write a Python3 script or Java that will interact with your
database and perform select queries (see below for list of queries).
2.4 Design an interface to access the queries via the programming language of your choice.
